# 🫀 The Quran Heart

**The Quran Heart** is an interactive visual experience designed to help Muslims track their Quran memorization journey in a meaningful and inspiring way.

Each Surah of the Quran is represented as a part of a heart.  
As you memorize a Surah, its corresponding section lights up — symbolizing that the Quran is being engraved into the heart, not just memorized by the mind.
